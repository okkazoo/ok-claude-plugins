# Knowledge Base Plugin for Claude Code

Persistent knowledge management for Claude Code projects with work-in-progress tracking, checkpoints, and auto-indexing.

## Features

- **Work-in-Progress Tracking**: Save progress between sessions with `/knowledge-base:wip`
- **Checkpoints**: Create restore points before risky changes
- **Auto-Indexing**: Code symbols and knowledge automatically indexed
- **Pre-Search Context**: Knowledge surfaced before searches via hooks

## Installation

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add yourusername/claude-knowledge-plugin

# Install plugin
/plugin install knowledge-base@claude-knowledge-plugin
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/knowledge-base:init` | Initialize knowledge base in current project |
| `/knowledge-base:wip` | Save work-in-progress |
| `/knowledge-base:wip -f <text>` | Save a fact directly |
