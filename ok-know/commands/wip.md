# Work In Progress Capture

## CRITICAL: Context Analysis

**IMPORTANT**: Always analyze the ENTIRE conversation context, not just recent messages.
This includes any compacted/summarized content from earlier in the session.
The goal is to capture the complete journey to prevent repeating mistakes.

## Argument Detection

**Check what argument was provided:**

1. **`-f <text>` or `-fact <text>`** → Go to "Fact Flag" section (direct save to facts/)
2. **No argument / empty / just "wip"** → Go to "No Arguments (Autonomous Mode)" section

---

## Usage

```
wip -f <text>        Save fact/gotcha directly to knowledge/facts/
wip -fact <text>     Same as -f

wip                  Autonomous mode - analyzes FULL conversation context
                     - Detects all topics discussed (even across compacted context)
                     - Presents clickable options to select which to save
                     - Supports multi-select for saving multiple items at once
```

---

## Fact Flag (`-f` or `-fact`)

**Direct save to `knowledge/facts/` - no AI detection needed.**

### Usage
- `wip -f On Windows use python not python3`
- `wip -fact API rate limit is 100 requests per minute`

### Instructions

1. **Extract the text** after `-f` or `-fact`

2. **Duplicate Check** (quick dupe-check before saving):
   ```bash
   python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_wip_helpers.py" find_similar_facts "<text>"
   ```

   **If similar facts found (count > 0):**
   - Display the similar facts to the user
   - Use AskUserQuestion:
     ```json
     {
       "questions": [{
         "question": "Similar fact(s) already exist. What would you like to do?",
         "header": "Duplicate?",
         "multiSelect": false,
         "options": [
           {"label": "Save anyway", "description": "Create new fact (may be redundant)"},
           {"label": "Update existing", "description": "Replace the most similar fact with this one"},
           {"label": "Cancel", "description": "Don't save - existing fact is sufficient"}
         ]
       }]
     }
     ```
   - If "Save anyway" → continue to step 3
   - If "Update existing" → delete the most similar fact file, then continue to step 3
   - If "Cancel" → exit without saving

3. **Create fact file** (use Python heredoc to avoid shell escaping):
   ```bash
   python - "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts" << 'PYEOF'
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, sys.argv[1])
   from _wip_helpers import save_fact
   save_fact("""<text>""")
   PYEOF
   ```

   Note: Use triple quotes for content. Escape `"""` as `\"\"\"` if it appears in text.

   This creates: `.claude/knowledge/facts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`

   File format:
   ```markdown
   # Fact: <brief preview>

   ## Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

   <full fact text>
   ```

4. **Confirm to user** (use blue for facts):
   ```
   \033[94mSaved to facts/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md\033[0m
   ```

## No Arguments (Autonomous Mode)

**Analyzes the ENTIRE conversation (including compacted context) and detects all topics.**

### Step 1: Analyze Full Conversation Context

**CRITICAL**: Analyze the ENTIRE conversation, not just recent messages.
This includes any compacted/summarized content visible in your context.

Scan for:

**Facts** (standalone learnings):
- Gotchas discovered ("X doesn't work because Y")
- Rules learned ("Always use X", "Never do Y")
- Configuration values, platform-specific behaviors

**Journey topics** (work-in-progress areas):
- Features being implemented
- Bugs being investigated/fixed
- Refactoring efforts
- Any distinct area of work

### Step 2: Detect All Topics

Identify ALL distinct topics/work areas from the full conversation.

A "topic" is a separable piece of work that could be its own journey entry.
Look for topic boundaries like:
- Switching from one feature to another
- Moving from bug X to bug Y
- Different areas of the codebase
- Distinct problem domains

### Step 3: Display Items and Present Options

**First, display detected items as formatted text:**

```
Analyzing full conversation...

FACTS
----------------------------------
[F1] API rate limit is 100 req/min
[F2] Windows needs Python313 in PATH first


JOURNEYS
----------------------------------
[J1] wip-command-ui-improvements
     Removed -j flag, added AskUserQuestion

[J2] hook-error-debugging
     Debugged PreToolUse:Grep hook error
```

**Then, use AskUserQuestion for selection:**

```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Type F1,J2 in Other to select specific items:",
    "header": "Save WIP",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Save ALL", "description": "Save all 2 facts and 2 journeys"},
      {"label": "Cancel", "description": "Exit without saving"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Handling responses:**
- User selects "Save ALL" → Save all detected items
- User selects "Cancel" → Exit without saving
- User selects "Other" and types `F1,J2` → Save only those items
- User selects "Other" and types `all` → Save all items

**Edge cases:**

**Single item detected:** Use confirmation-style question:
```json
{
  "questions": [{
    "question": "Save this entry?",
    "header": "Save WIP",
    "multiSelect": false,
    "options": [
      {"label": "Yes, save it", "description": "<item-type>: <brief summary>"},
      {"label": "No, cancel", "description": "Exit without saving"}
    ]
  }]
}
```

**Only facts OR only journeys:** Skip the empty section header, just show what exists.

### Step 4: For Each Selected Topic

For each journey topic selected:

1. **Find existing categories** (to choose appropriate one):
   ```bash
   python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_wip_helpers.py" scan_categories
   ```

2. **Extract content for THIS topic** from full conversation:
   - What was tried (including failures)
   - What worked
   - Mistakes made and lessons learned
   - Current state
   - What's still pending
   - Key code changes
   - Open questions

3. **Build the entry content** following this template:

   ```markdown
   # WIP: <Brief Title>

   ## Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

   ## What Was Tried
   - [Approach 1] - [result: worked/failed] - [why]
   - [Approach 2] - [result: worked/failed] - [why]

   ## Mistakes & Learnings
   - [What went wrong] → [Lesson learned]
   - [Another mistake] → [What to do instead]

   ## Progress Made
   - [x] [Completed item 1]
   - [x] [Completed item 2]

   ## Current State
   [Where things stand now]

   ## Still TODO
   - [ ] [Pending item 1]
   - [ ] [Pending item 2]

   ### Solutions Found
   - **[Pattern that worked]** - context: keyword1, keyword2, keyword3

   ### Tried But Failed
   - **[What didn't work]** - Failed because: [reason] - context: keyword1, keyword2

   ### Gotchas
   - **[Unexpected issue discovered]** - context: keyword1, keyword2

   ### Best Practices
   - **[Practice to follow]** - context: keyword1, keyword2

   ## Code Changes
   ```[language]
   [key snippets - especially patterns that worked or failed]
   ```

   ## Files Modified
   - path/to/file1.py
   - path/to/file2.jsx
   ```

4. **Create the entry using the helper** (use Python heredoc to avoid shell escaping):
   ```bash
   python - "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts" << 'PYEOF'
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, sys.argv[1])
   from _wip_helpers import create_entry
   create_entry("<category>", "<topic>", """<content>""")
   PYEOF
   ```

   Note: Use triple quotes for content. Escape `"""` as `\"\"\"` if it appears in content.

   Returns JSON with: `success`, `file`, `category`, `topic`, `patterns_indexed`

### Step 5: Show Summary

After saving all selected items, use color coding:
- **Facts**: Blue (`\033[94m`)
- **Journeys**: Green (`\033[92m`)
- Reset: `\033[0m`

```
Saved:

  \033[94m[F1] Fact: "On Windows use python not python3"
        → facts/2024-12-21-windows-python.md\033[0m

  \033[92m[J1] auth-token-refresh
        → authentication/token-refresh/2024-12-21-15-30-oauth-cookies.md
        Key learnings: JWT failed (CORS), HTTP-only cookies work\033[0m

  \033[92m[J2] database-migration
        → infrastructure/database-migration/2024-12-21-15-30-user-prefs.md\033[0m

Total: \033[94m1 fact\033[0m, \033[92m2 journeys\033[0m saved
```
