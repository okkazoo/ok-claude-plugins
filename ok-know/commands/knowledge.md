# Knowledge Base Status

## Arguments

- No argument: Show knowledge base status (tree view with details)
- `-audit`: Audit knowledge base for issues (redundant facts, consolidation opportunities, orphaned references)
- `-reset`: Reset knowledge base to factory defaults (with options)

## Instructions

### First: Ensure Knowledge Base Exists

```bash
if [ ! -d ".claude/knowledge" ]; then
  echo "Knowledge base not initialized. Run /ok-know:install first."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Check argument and run appropriate command

**If argument is `-audit`:**
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_wip_helpers.py" audit_knowledge
```
Display the audit report EXACTLY as returned, then if issues were found, use **AskUserQuestion** to ask if user wants to:
- **Fix automatically** - Merge redundant facts, consolidate journeys, clean orphaned refs
- **Show details** - Explain each issue in more detail
- **Cancel** - Take no action

---

**If argument is `-reset`:**

1. First, show what will be affected (dry run):
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_wip_helpers.py" reset_knowledge
```

2. Use **AskUserQuestion** tool to ask the user which option they want:
   - **Archive & Reset** - Save current knowledge to timestamped archive, then reset
   - **Full Reset** - Delete all knowledge permanently (cannot be undone)
   - **Cancel** - Abort reset, keep everything

3. Based on user's choice, run the appropriate command.

---

**Otherwise (no argument):**
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/_wip_helpers.py" knowledge_status
```

## CRITICAL OUTPUT RULES

After running the command above:
1. Display the command output EXACTLY as it appears
2. **STOP** - Do NOT add any text after the output
3. Do NOT summarize what you see
4. Do NOT offer suggestions or next steps
5. Do NOT interpret the data

Your entire response after the bash command should be empty. The command output IS the response.

## Notes

- The Python script returns pre-formatted markdown output
- Archives are saved to `.claude/knowledge-archive-{timestamp}/`
- Factory defaults preserve folder structure but clear all content
